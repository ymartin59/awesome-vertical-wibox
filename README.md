# awesome-vertical-wibox

Always used a vertical panel in Gnome 2, here is an initial setup of Awesome VM
3.5 base on Debian package with a vertical wibox.

Standard key bindings are documented with keydoc module.

Tags are also organized vertically so up/down navigation commands are
configured in addition to left/right I kept until you find a better usage for
them.
